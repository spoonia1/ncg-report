# To Run the code:  
### Task 1-   
It is situated on top of the Colab notebook with label ``Task 1 Contribution Sentences``. Utilizing a GPU is recommended (not TPU).  
Training, Dev and Test Dataset is cloned from [github repo](https://github.com/spoonia1/ncg-report/).  
- Step 1: In section 2.2, 2nd cell, location of training dataset is entered at ``os.chdir('/content/ncg-report/Train v2')``, this can be modified as per need.  
- Step 2: Run the code up to Training, marked as Section 5. Enter the evaluation dataset path as `os.chdir('/content/ncg-report/Test v2')`. Proceed to the f1 and MCC scores.  
- Method to save the fine-tuned model is provided in the Appendix section and that's where Task-1 terminates.   


### Task 2-
